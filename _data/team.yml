  bio: >
  I am a Senior Lecturer in Systems Microbiology at the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/biosciences/">Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University</a>, and a UKRI Future Leader Fellow. I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/">Newcastle University</a> in the laboratory of Waldemar Vollmer, where I studied bacterial cell wall biology. I subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at <a href="https://kirchhausen.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> as an EMBO Fellow with Tomas Kirchhausen and later at the <a href="https://www.embl.org/">European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</a> in Heidelberg with Nassos Typas. My early research focused on bacterial cell envelope biology, high-throughput genetic screens, and host-pathogen interactions. Between 2018 and 2022, I was a Birmingham Fellow at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/biosciences/index.aspx">School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham</a>, and subsequently held a UKRI Future Leader Fellowship there. My current research combines high-throughput experimental approaches and computational methods to study phenotypic variability in pathogens, with a particular focus on the bacterial cell envelope and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.

  bio: >
    I am an undergraduate student in MBB at SFU and a long-term volunteer with the lab.
    My duties include the routine processing of blood samples to isolate plasma and cell pellet for later analysis ( eg. Circulating tumor DNA)
    along with purification of the cell-free DNA from plasmas utilizing the MagMax cell-free DNA isolation kit and subsequent procedures.
    I also assist in the canine B-cell lymphoma project specifically in the wet lab setting. I have a complete obsession with anything to do with animals and currently volunteer at a veterinary hospital.
    I plan to study veterinary medicine after completing my BSc.

    My project focuses on using machine learning to detect and filter sequencing artifacts
    in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. This will enable more robust variant
    calling in FFPE tumours which remains a major limitation in the transition from fresh
    frozen tissues. I am also using interpretable machine learning approaches to classify
    subtypes of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas.

    I am an undergraduate student completing a BSc in MBB and joined the laboratory after completing MBB 342.
    My honors project in the Morin lab focuses on the Fc-gamma receptor locus and the relationship between common germline copy number alterations and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
    I am using custom multiplex droplet digital PCR assays to determine the copy number state of five genes in this locus across large cohorts of cases and controls.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming adopted as a
    sensitive biomarker for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response
    in many cancer types.
    Stephen's work helped to establish and validate numerous assays for
    quantifying ctDNA in plasma from lymphoma patients based on common hot spot mutations in genes such as EZH2 and STAT6.
    These assays demonstrated prognostic utility of ctDNA in multiple
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27166360">clinical trials</a> and helped describe <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/22/9/2290">patterns of clonal evolution in DLBCL</a>.

    Lymphoma is the most common cancer affecting pet dogs. Kevin used
    genomic techniques to identify mutations involved in lymphomagenesis
    in canine B-cell lymphoma.
    His work identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25468570">TRAF3</a> as one of the most commonly mutated genes
    in this cancer. Kevin also studied the potential utility of ctDNA in a
    variety of human cancers using several techniques including the OnTarget system from Boreal Genomics.
    He joined the laboratory full-time after graduating and has since transitioned to law school.

    Arezoo generated and analyzed exome sequence data from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
    mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumours.
    Her thesis project involved a combination of wet-lab work and bioinformatics including a meta-analysis of published and in-house
    exome data to identify new recurrently-mutated genes in MCL. Her discoveries a novel silent mutation hot spot in MAP3K14. She also demonstrated patterns of clonal evolution in relapsed DLBCL.
