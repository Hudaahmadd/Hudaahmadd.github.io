  bio: >
  I am a Senior Lecturer in Systems Microbiology at the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/biosciences/">Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University</a>, and a UKRI Future Leader Fellow. I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/">Newcastle University</a> in the laboratory of Waldemar Vollmer, where I studied bacterial cell wall biology. I subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at <a href="https://kirchhausen.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> as an EMBO Fellow with Tomas Kirchhausen and later at the <a href="https://www.embl.org/">European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</a> in Heidelberg with Nassos Typas. My early research focused on bacterial cell envelope biology, high-throughput genetic screens, and host-pathogen interactions. Between 2018 and 2022, I was a Birmingham Fellow at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/biosciences/index.aspx">School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham</a>, and subsequently held a UKRI Future Leader Fellowship there. My current research combines high-throughput experimental approaches and computational methods to study phenotypic variability in pathogens, with a particular focus on the bacterial cell envelope and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.
