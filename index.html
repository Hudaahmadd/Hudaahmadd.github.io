    The Banzhaf Laboratory uses high-throughput approaches to link genotype to phenotype in human pathogens. These methods enable the quantification of strain fitness across diverse chemical and environmental conditions, facilitating the discovery of gene function and the mapping of biological pathways. A key focus is the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope, which plays a major role in antimicrobial resistance.  Our laboratory develops a high-throughput approach to systematically assay envelope integrity and envelope biogenesis for Gram-negative human pathogens.
